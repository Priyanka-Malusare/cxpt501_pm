I imported digoxin data set. Removed Nan Values and replaced them with not given.The columns of interest were AGE,HYPERTEN,SEX,KLEVEL,DIGDOSE,CVD,WHF,DIG,NHOSP,DEATH,REASON,DWHF,EJF_PER,EJFMETH.I then removed NHOSP outliers by calculating the 25th and 75th quartiles. Then I calculated the interquartile range. To determine the minimum and maximum I used the 25th and 75th quartile numbers and added or subtracted them by 1.5 * the interquartile range. Then I saved the dataframe to the startingData folder.
