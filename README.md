I created necessary folders and sub folders for my project.After exporting DIGOXIN data, I cleaned and reduced it using data manipulation and cleaning.The columns of interest were selected.I removed the outliers from my data.I I then used Data Visualization techniques to plot two graphs;DIGOXIN dose Vs CVD and DIGOXIN dose Vs Death,saved in figures folder.Lastly I created a probability matrix of CVD and SEX, saved in results folder.
